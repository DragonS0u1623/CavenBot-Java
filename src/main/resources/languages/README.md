# Language Support
So I decided to make multi-language support a feature for the bot, but I'm not near fluent in anything other than English. I will definitely leave this open to contributions, but read below for the rules of contribution and how to get a hold of me to contribute.

# Rules For Contribution:
1. Don't change any of the names for the json keys. They won't work correctly if you do.
2. Try to keep to a similar meaning for the translation. Slight variation is fine, but don't remove any `%s` or `%d` from the translation.
3. Keep the formatting the same. So if you see something in \*\*bold\*\* then it should stay in \*\*bold\*\* after translation.

# How to Contribute:
The easiest way to get a hold of me is to contact me on discord at `Teddy Bear Incâ„¢#1525`
If there are any issues with a translation or typos you can reach me at the same handle or in the [official support server](https://discord.gg/6TjuPYy)
